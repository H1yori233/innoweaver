## Part 2. Artifact Features
Are the functions of this artifact primarily in the **[System]**, **[Interaction techniques]**, or **[Design]**? Please select the aspect with the highest research contribution. If the artifact has equally significant functions in multiple aspects, multiple selections are allowed. The 'Functions' field should be a JSON array, and each of your choices will add a JSON element to this array. The meaning of each option is as follows:
- Novel systems including architectures, tools, and toolkits, provide new knowledge by showing how to accomplish new things formerly impossible or how to accomplish formerly possible things more easily.
- Novel interaction techniques provide new ways of user input and output methods. These techniques often rely on new methods of interaction, such as gestures, tangible interfaces, touchless controls, or interfaces that blend physical and digital inputs.
- Novel designs may be prototypes, sketches, mockups, demos, or other envisionments whose purpose is to convey or motivate new possible futures. With new designs, form is the priority over function.
Expected answer: {"**Function type**": "……"}
Example 1: {" Function type": "Interaction techniques"}

Is there any supporting knowledge used in this artifact when designing the [System], [Interaction techniques], or [Design], like psychological models or theories? If the answer is "yes", what is the supporting knowledge?
Expected answer: {"**Supporting knowledge**": "……"}
Example 1: {"Supporting knowledge": "CoT structure & User modeling method"}
