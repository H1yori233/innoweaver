# InnoWeaver Rule
This project is a website that contains both frontend and backend,
the **ROOT** is the backend part, written by `Python` `FastAPI`,
the **/interface** is the frontend part, written by `NextJS`, `Tailwind CSS`

Please Keep your code clean and simple, you dont have to write a lot of comments.

## Code Standards
- All code and comments must be in English
- Use meaningful variable names, minimal comments
- Follow industrial-grade practices

## Frontend Guidelines (/interface)
- Modify only within /interface directory
- Use pnpm for package management
- Apply Apple's design principles: clean, minimal, intuitive
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind utilities
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Implement proper error handling and loading states

## Backend Guidelines (ROOT)
the API part is in the **/fast_routes**, and core code is in **utils**.
The program use MongoDB, Redis and Meilisearch as Database.
You should always consider the performance of System, make the server compatible with high concurrency.

## Development Workflow
- No documentation generation required
- No automated testing setup needed
- Focus on production-ready, scalable code
- Prioritize code readability and maintainability
